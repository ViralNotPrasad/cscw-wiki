All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} However, the State\'s constituent assembly dissolved itself on 25 January 1957 without recommending either abrogation or amendment of the Article 370.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government.

The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954.===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954.

However, the State Legislature was empowered to legislate on preventive detention for the purpose of internal security. The State\'s land reform legislation (which acquired land without compensation) was also protected.\n# The jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of India]] was extended to the State.\n# The Central Government was given power to declare [[Part XVIII of the Constitution of India|national emergency]] in the event of external aggression.

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda. They joined the Constituent Assembly on 16 June 1949.</ref> requested that only those provisions of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the original Instrument of Accession should be applied to the State and that the state\'s constituent assembly, when formed, would decide on the other matters. Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May. It said in particular, "It will be for the Constituent Assembly of the State when convened, to determine in respect of which other subjects the state may accede".{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011||loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}}} Accordingly, the Article 370 was incorporated into the Indian Constitution, which stipulated that the other articles of the Constitution that gave powers to the Central Government would be applied to Jammu and Kashmir only with the concurrence of the State\'s constituent assembly.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954.===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954. Issued with the agreement of the State\'s Constituent Assembly, it was a comprehensive order seeking to implement the 1952 Delhi Agreement.{{sfnp|Chowdhary, Politics of Identity and Separatism|2015|p=48}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}  Arguably, it went further than the Delhi Agreement in some respects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|pp=171–172}}\n\nThe provisions implementing the Delhi Agreement were:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=198–200,&nbsp;212}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|pp=97–98}}\n# Indian citizenship was extended to the \'permanent residents\' of Jammu and Kashmir (formerly called \'state subjects\'). Simultaneously, the [[Article 35A of Constitution of India|Article 35A]] was added to the Constitution, empowering the state legislature to legislate on the privileges of permanent residents with regard to immovable property, settlement in the state and employment.\n# The [[Fundamental rights in India|fundamental rights]] of the Indian constitution were extended to the state. However, the State Legislature was empowered to legislate on preventive detention for the purpose of internal security. The State\'s land reform legislation (which acquired land without compensation) was also protected.\n# The jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of India]] was extended to the State.\n# The Central Government was given power to declare [[Part XVIII of the Constitution of India|national emergency]] in the event of external aggression. However, its power to do so for internal disturbances could be exercised only with the concurrence of the State Government.\nIn addition, the following provisions which were not previously decided in the Delhi Agreement were also implemented:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=212}}{{sfnp|Mir Qasim, My Life and Times|1992|p=60}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}\n# Financial relations between the Centre and the State were placed on the same footing as the other States.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will". The successors of Nanda in the Home Ministry have interpreted the Article in the same manner.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1–2, Chapter 9 Doc#2}}\n\n==Autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir: Structure and limitations==\nIndia\'s constitution is a [[Federalism in India|federal structure]]. The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} However, the State\'s constituent assembly dissolved itself on 25 January 1957 without recommending either abrogation or amendment of the Article 370.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights\'\'\'.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\').

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda. They joined the Constituent Assembly on 16 June 1949.</ref> requested that only those provisions of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the original Instrument of Accession should be applied to the State and that the state\'s constituent assembly, when formed, would decide on the other matters. Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May. It said in particular, "It will be for the Constituent Assembly of the State when convened, to determine in respect of which other subjects the state may accede".{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011||loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}}} Accordingly, the Article 370 was incorporated into the Indian Constitution, which stipulated that the other articles of the Constitution that gave powers to the Central Government would be applied to Jammu and Kashmir only with the concurrence of the State\'s constituent assembly.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954.===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954. Issued with the agreement of the State\'s Constituent Assembly, it was a comprehensive order seeking to implement the 1952 Delhi Agreement.{{sfnp|Chowdhary, Politics of Identity and Separatism|2015|p=48}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}  Arguably, it went further than the Delhi Agreement in some respects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|pp=171–172}}\n\nThe provisions implementing the Delhi Agreement were:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=198–200,&nbsp;212}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|pp=97–98}}\n# Indian citizenship was extended to the \'permanent residents\' of Jammu and Kashmir (formerly called \'state subjects\'). Simultaneously, the [[Article 35A of Constitution of India|Article 35A]] was added to the Constitution, empowering the state legislature to legislate on the privileges of permanent residents with regard to immovable property, settlement in the state and employment.\n# The [[Fundamental rights in India|fundamental rights]] of the Indian constitution were extended to the state. However, the State Legislature was empowered to legislate on preventive detention for the purpose of internal security. The State\'s land reform legislation (which acquired land without compensation) was also protected.\n# The jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of India]] was extended to the State.\n# The Central Government was given power to declare [[Part XVIII of the Constitution of India|national emergency]] in the event of external aggression. However, its power to do so for internal disturbances could be exercised only with the concurrence of the State Government.\nIn addition, the following provisions which were not previously decided in the Delhi Agreement were also implemented:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=212}}{{sfnp|Mir Qasim, My Life and Times|1992|p=60}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}\n# Financial relations between the Centre and the State were placed on the same footing as the other States.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will". The successors of Nanda in the Home Ministry have interpreted the Article in the same manner.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1–2, Chapter 9 Doc#2}}\n\n==Autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir: Structure and limitations==\nIndia\'s constitution is a [[Federalism in India|federal structure]]. The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} However, the State\'s constituent assembly dissolved itself on 25 January 1957 without recommending either abrogation or amendment of the Article 370.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\').

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda. They joined the Constituent Assembly on 16 June 1949.</ref> requested that only those provisions of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the original Instrument of Accession should be applied to the State and that the state\'s constituent assembly, when formed, would decide on the other matters. Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May. It said in particular, "It will be for the Constituent Assembly of the State when convened, to determine in respect of which other subjects the state may accede".{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011||loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}}} Accordingly, the Article 370 was incorporated into the Indian Constitution, which stipulated that the other articles of the Constitution that gave powers to the Central Government would be applied to Jammu and Kashmir only with the concurrence of the State\'s constituent assembly.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954.===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954. Issued with the agreement of the State\'s Constituent Assembly, it was a comprehensive order seeking to implement the 1952 Delhi Agreement.{{sfnp|Chowdhary, Politics of Identity and Separatism|2015|p=48}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}  Arguably, it went further than the Delhi Agreement in some respects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|pp=171–172}}\n\nThe provisions implementing the Delhi Agreement were:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=198–200,&nbsp;212}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|pp=97–98}}\n# Indian citizenship was extended to the \'permanent residents\' of Jammu and Kashmir (formerly called \'state subjects\'). Simultaneously, the [[Article 35A of Constitution of India|Article 35A]] was added to the Constitution, empowering the state legislature to legislate on the privileges of permanent residents with regard to immovable property, settlement in the state and employment.\n# The [[Fundamental rights in India|fundamental rights]] of the Indian constitution were extended to the state. However, the State Legislature was empowered to legislate on preventive detention for the purpose of internal security. The State\'s land reform legislation (which acquired land without compensation) was also protected.\n# The jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of India]] was extended to the State.\n# The Central Government was given power to declare [[Part XVIII of the Constitution of India|national emergency]] in the event of external aggression. However, its power to do so for internal disturbances could be exercised only with the concurrence of the State Government.\nIn addition, the following provisions which were not previously decided in the Delhi Agreement were also implemented:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=212}}{{sfnp|Mir Qasim, My Life and Times|1992|p=60}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}\n# Financial relations between the Centre and the State were placed on the same footing as the other States.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will". The successors of Nanda in the Home Ministry have interpreted the Article in the same manner.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1–2, Chapter 9 Doc#2}}\n\n==Autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir: Structure and limitations==\nIndia\'s constitution is a [[Federalism in India|federal structure]]. The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} However, the State\'s constituent assembly dissolved itself on 25 January 1957 without recommending either abrogation or amendment of the Article 370.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement.

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda. They joined the Constituent Assembly on 16 June 1949.</ref> requested that only those provisions of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the original Instrument of Accession should be applied to the State and that the state\'s constituent assembly, when formed, would decide on the other matters. Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May. It said in particular, "It will be for the Constituent Assembly of the State when convened, to determine in respect of which other subjects the state may accede".{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011||loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}}} Accordingly, the Article 370 was incorporated into the Indian Constitution, which stipulated that the other articles of the Constitution that gave powers to the Central Government would be applied to Jammu and Kashmir only with the concurrence of the State\'s constituent assembly.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954.===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954. Issued with the agreement of the State\'s Constituent Assembly, it was a comprehensive order seeking to implement the 1952 Delhi Agreement.{{sfnp|Chowdhary, Politics of Identity and Separatism|2015|p=48}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}  Arguably, it went further than the Delhi Agreement in some respects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|pp=171–172}}\n\nThe provisions implementing the Delhi Agreement were:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=198–200,&nbsp;212}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|pp=97–98}}\n# Indian citizenship was extended to the \'permanent residents\' of Jammu and Kashmir (formerly called \'state subjects\'). Simultaneously, the [[Article 35A of Constitution of India|Article 35A]] was added to the Constitution, empowering the state legislature to legislate on the privileges of permanent residents with regard to immovable property, settlement in the state and employment.\n# The [[Fundamental rights in India|fundamental rights]] of the Indian constitution were extended to the state. However, the State Legislature was empowered to legislate on preventive detention for the purpose of internal security. The State\'s land reform legislation (which acquired land without compensation) was also protected.\n# The jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of India]] was extended to the State.\n# The Central Government was given power to declare [[Part XVIII of the Constitution of India|national emergency]] in the event of external aggression. However, its power to do so for internal disturbances could be exercised only with the concurrence of the State Government.\nIn addition, the following provisions which were not previously decided in the Delhi Agreement were also implemented:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=212}}{{sfnp|Mir Qasim, My Life and Times|1992|p=60}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}\n# Financial relations between the Centre and the State were placed on the same footing as the other States.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will". The successors of Nanda in the Home Ministry have interpreted the Article in the same manner.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1–2, Chapter 9 Doc#2}}\n\n==Autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir: Structure and limitations==\nIndia\'s constitution is a [[Federalism in India|federal structure]]. The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} However, the State\'s constituent assembly dissolved itself on 25 January 1957 without recommending either abrogation or amendment of the Article 370.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\').

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-seven subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six subjects covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]]of forty-seven subjects, on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven subjects in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven subjects applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda. They joined the Constituent Assembly on 16 June 1949.</ref> requested that only those provisions of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the original Instrument of Accession should be applied to the State and that the state\'s constituent assembly, when formed, would decide on the other matters. Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May. It said in particular, "It will be for the Constituent Assembly of the State when convened, to determine in respect of which other subjects the state may accede".{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011||loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}}} Accordingly, the Article 370 was incorporated into the Indian Constitution, which stipulated that the other articles of the Constitution that gave powers to the Central Government would be applied to Jammu and Kashmir only with the concurrence of the State\'s constituent assembly.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954.===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954. Issued with the agreement of the State\'s Constituent Assembly, it was a comprehensive order seeking to implement the 1952 Delhi Agreement.{{sfnp|Chowdhary, Politics of Identity and Separatism|2015|p=48}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}  Arguably, it went further than the Delhi Agreement in some respects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|pp=171–172}}\n\nThe provisions implementing the Delhi Agreement were:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=198–200,&nbsp;212}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|pp=97–98}}\n# Indian citizenship was extended to the \'permanent residents\' of Jammu and Kashmir (formerly called \'state subjects\'). Simultaneously, the [[Article 35A of Constitution of India|Article 35A]] was added to the Constitution, empowering the state legislature to legislate on the privileges of permanent residents with regard to immovable property, settlement in the state and employment.\n# The [[Fundamental rights in India|fundamental rights]] of the Indian constitution were extended to the state. However, the State Legislature was empowered to legislate on preventive detention for the purpose of internal security. The State\'s land reform legislation (which acquired land without compensation) was also protected.\n# The jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of India]] was extended to the State.\n# The Central Government was given power to declare [[Part XVIII of the Constitution of India|national emergency]] in the event of external aggression. However, its power to do so for internal disturbances could be exercised only with the concurrence of the State Government.\nIn addition, the following provisions which were not previously decided in the Delhi Agreement were also implemented:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=212}}{{sfnp|Mir Qasim, My Life and Times|1992|p=60}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}\n# Financial relations between the Centre and the State were placed on the same footing as the other States.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will". The successors of Nanda in the Home Ministry have interpreted the Article in the same manner.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1–2, Chapter 9 Doc#2}}\n\n==Autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir: Structure and limitations==\nIndia\'s constitution is a [[Federalism in India|federal structure]]. The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-seven subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six subjects covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]]of forty-seven subjects, on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven subjects in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven subjects applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} However, the State\'s constituent assembly dissolved itself on 25 January 1957 without recommending either abrogation or amendment of the Article 370.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\').

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-seven subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda. They joined the Constituent Assembly on 16 June 1949.</ref> requested that only those provisions of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the original Instrument of Accession should be applied to the State and that the state\'s constituent assembly, when formed, would decide on the other matters. Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May. It said in particular, "It will be for the Constituent Assembly of the State when convened, to determine in respect of which other subjects the state may accede".{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011||loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}}} Accordingly, the Article 370 was incorporated into the Indian Constitution, which stipulated that the other articles of the Constitution that gave powers to the Central Government would be applied to Jammu and Kashmir only with the concurrence of the State\'s constituent assembly.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954.===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954. Issued with the agreement of the State\'s Constituent Assembly, it was a comprehensive order seeking to implement the 1952 Delhi Agreement.{{sfnp|Chowdhary, Politics of Identity and Separatism|2015|p=48}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}  Arguably, it went further than the Delhi Agreement in some respects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|pp=171–172}}\n\nThe provisions implementing the Delhi Agreement were:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=198–200,&nbsp;212}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|pp=97–98}}\n# Indian citizenship was extended to the \'permanent residents\' of Jammu and Kashmir (formerly called \'state subjects\'). Simultaneously, the [[Article 35A of Constitution of India|Article 35A]] was added to the Constitution, empowering the state legislature to legislate on the privileges of permanent residents with regard to immovable property, settlement in the state and employment.\n# The [[Fundamental rights in India|fundamental rights]] of the Indian constitution were extended to the state. However, the State Legislature was empowered to legislate on preventive detention for the purpose of internal security. The State\'s land reform legislation (which acquired land without compensation) was also protected.\n# The jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of India]] was extended to the State.\n# The Central Government was given power to declare [[Part XVIII of the Constitution of India|national emergency]] in the event of external aggression. However, its power to do so for internal disturbances could be exercised only with the concurrence of the State Government.\nIn addition, the following provisions which were not previously decided in the Delhi Agreement were also implemented:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=212}}{{sfnp|Mir Qasim, My Life and Times|1992|p=60}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}\n# Financial relations between the Centre and the State were placed on the same footing as the other States.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will". The successors of Nanda in the Home Ministry have interpreted the Article in the same manner.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1–2, Chapter 9 Doc#2}}\n\n==Autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir: Structure and limitations==\nIndia\'s constitution is a [[Federalism in India|federal structure]]. The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda. They joined the Constituent Assembly on 16 June 1949.</ref> requested that only those provisions of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the original Instrument of Accession should be applied to the State and that the state\'s constituent assembly, when formed, would decide on the other matters. Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} However, the State\'s constituent assembly dissolved itself on 25 January 1957 without recommending either abrogation or amendment of the Article 370.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement.

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-seven subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda. They joined the Constituent Assembly on 16 June 1949.</ref> requested that only those provisions of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the original Instrument of Accession should be applied to the State and that the state\'s constituent assembly, when formed, would decide on the other matters. Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May. It said in particular, "It will be for the Constituent Assembly of the State when convened, to determine in respect of which other subjects the state may accede".{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011||loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}}} Accordingly, the Article 370 was incorporated into the Indian Constitution, which stipulated that the other articles of the Constitution that gave powers to the Central Government would be applied to Jammu and Kashmir only with the concurrence of the State\'s constituent assembly.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954.===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954. Issued with the agreement of the State\'s Constituent Assembly, it was a comprehensive order seeking to implement the 1952 Delhi Agreement.{{sfnp|Chowdhary, Politics of Identity and Separatism|2015|p=48}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}  Arguably, it went further than the Delhi Agreement in some respects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|pp=171–172}}\n\nThe provisions implementing the Delhi Agreement were:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=198–200,&nbsp;212}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|pp=97–98}}\n# Indian citizenship was extended to the \'permanent residents\' of Jammu and Kashmir (formerly called \'state subjects\'). Simultaneously, the [[Article 35A of Constitution of India|Article 35A]] was added to the Constitution, empowering the state legislature to legislate on the privileges of permanent residents with regard to immovable property, settlement in the state and employment.\n# The [[Fundamental rights in India|fundamental rights]] of the Indian constitution were extended to the state. However, the State Legislature was empowered to legislate on preventive detention for the purpose of internal security. The State\'s land reform legislation (which acquired land without compensation) was also protected.\n# The jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of India]] was extended to the State.\n# The Central Government was given power to declare [[Part XVIII of the Constitution of India|national emergency]] in the event of external aggression. However, its power to do so for internal disturbances could be exercised only with the concurrence of the State Government.\nIn addition, the following provisions which were not previously decided in the Delhi Agreement were also implemented:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=212}}{{sfnp|Mir Qasim, My Life and Times|1992|p=60}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}\n# Financial relations between the Centre and the State were placed on the same footing as the other States.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will". The successors of Nanda in the Home Ministry have interpreted the Article in the same manner.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1–2, Chapter 9 Doc#2}}\n\n==Autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir: Structure and limitations==\nIndia\'s constitution is a [[Federalism in India|federal structure]]. The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} However, the State\'s constituent assembly dissolved itself on 25 January 1957 without recommending either abrogation or amendment of the Article 370.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement.

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda. They joined the Constituent Assembly on 16 June 1949.</ref> requested that only those provisions of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the original Instrument of Accession should be applied to the State and that the state\'s constituent assembly, when formed, would decide on the other matters. Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May. It said in particular, "It will be for the Constituent Assembly of the State when convened, to determine in respect of which other subjects the state may accede".{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011||loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}}} Accordingly, the Article 370 was incorporated into the Indian Constitution, which stipulated that the other articles of the Constitution that gave powers to the Central Government would be applied to Jammu and Kashmir only with the concurrence of the State\'s constituent assembly.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954.===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954. Issued with the agreement of the State\'s Constituent Assembly, it was a comprehensive order seeking to implement the 1952 Delhi Agreement.{{sfnp|Chowdhary, Politics of Identity and Separatism|2015|p=48}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}  Arguably, it went further than the Delhi Agreement in some respects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|pp=171–172}}\n\nThe provisions implementing the Delhi Agreement were:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=198–200,&nbsp;212}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|pp=97–98}}\n# Indian citizenship was extended to the \'permanent residents\' of Jammu and Kashmir (formerly called \'state subjects\'). Simultaneously, the [[Article 35A of Constitution of India|Article 35A]] was added to the Constitution, empowering the state legislature to legislate on the privileges of permanent residents with regard to immovable property, settlement in the state and employment.\n# The [[Fundamental rights in India|fundamental rights]] of the Indian constitution were extended to the state. However, the State Legislature was empowered to legislate on preventive detention for the purpose of internal security. The State\'s land reform legislation (which acquired land without compensation) was also protected.\n# The jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of India]] was extended to the State.\n# The Central Government was given power to declare [[Part XVIII of the Constitution of India|national emergency]] in the event of external aggression. However, its power to do so for internal disturbances could be exercised only with the concurrence of the State Government.\nIn addition, the following provisions which were not previously decided in the Delhi Agreement were also implemented:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=212}}{{sfnp|Mir Qasim, My Life and Times|1992|p=60}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}\n# Financial relations between the Centre and the State were placed on the same footing as the other States.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will". The successors of Nanda in the Home Ministry have interpreted the Article in the same manner.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1–2, Chapter 9 Doc#2}}\n\n==Autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir: Structure and limitations==\nIndia\'s constitution is a [[Federalism in India|federal structure]]. The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} However, the State\'s constituent assembly dissolved itself on 25 January 1957 without recommending either abrogation or amendment of the Article 370.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\').

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda. They joined the Constituent Assembly on 16 June 1949.</ref> requested that only those provisions of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the original Instrument of Accession should be applied to the State and that the state\'s constituent assembly, when formed, would decide on the other matters. Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May. It said in particular, "It will be for the Constituent Assembly of the State when convened, to determine in respect of which other subjects the state may accede".{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011||loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}}} Accordingly, the Article 370 was incorporated into the Indian Constitution, which stipulated that the other articles of the Constitution that gave powers to the Central Government would be applied to Jammu and Kashmir only with the concurrence of the State\'s constituent assembly.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954. Issued with the agreement of the State\'s Constituent Assembly, it was a comprehensive order seeking to implement the 1952 Delhi Agreement.{{sfnp|Chowdhary, Politics of Identity and Separatism|2015|p=48}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}  Arguably, it went further than the Delhi Agreement in some respects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|pp=171–172}}\n\nThe provisions implementing the Delhi Agreement were:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=198–200,&nbsp;212}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|pp=97–98}}\n# Indian citizenship was extended to the \'permanent residents\' of Jammu and Kashmir (formerly called \'state subjects\'). Simultaneously, the [[Article 35A of Constitution of India|Article 35A]] was added to the Constitution, empowering the state legislature to legislate on the privileges of permanent residents with regard to immovable property, settlement in the state and employment.\n# The [[Fundamental rights in India|fundamental rights]] of the Indian constitution were extended to the state. However, the State Legislature was empowered to legislate on preventive detention for the purpose of internal security. The State\'s land reform legislation (which acquired land without compensation) was also protected.\n# The jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of India]] was extended to the State.\n# The Central Government was given power to declare [[Part XVIII of the Constitution of India|national emergency]] in the event of external aggression. However, its power to do so for internal disturbances could be exercised only with the concurrence of the State Government.\nIn addition, the following provisions which were not previously decided in the Delhi Agreement were also implemented:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=212}}{{sfnp|Mir Qasim, My Life and Times|1992|p=60}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}\n# Financial relations between the Centre and the State were placed on the same footing as the other States.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will". The successors of Nanda in the Home Ministry have interpreted the Article in the same manner.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1–2, Chapter 9 Doc#2}}\n\n==Autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir: Structure and limitations==\nIndia\'s constitution is a [[Federalism in India|federal structure]]. The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda. They joined the Constituent Assembly on 16 June 1949.</ref> requested that only those provisions of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the original Instrument of Accession should be applied to the State and that the state\'s constituent assembly, when formed, would decide on the other matters. Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} However, the State\'s constituent assembly dissolved itself on 25 January 1957 without recommending either abrogation or amendment of the Article 370.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement.

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda. They joined the Constituent Assembly on 16 June 1949.</ref> requested that only those provisions of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the original Instrument of Accession should be applied to the State and that the state\'s constituent assembly, when formed, would decide on the other matters. Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May. It said in particular, "It will be for the Constituent Assembly of the State when convened, to determine in respect of which other subjects the state may accede".{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011||loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}}} Accordingly, the Article 370 was incorporated into the Indian Constitution, which stipulated that the other articles of the Constitution that gave powers to the Central Government would be applied to Jammu and Kashmir only with the concurrence of the State\'s constituent assembly.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954. Issued with the agreement of the State\'s Constituent Assembly, it was a comprehensive order seeking to implement the 1952 Delhi Agreement.{{sfnp|Chowdhary, Politics of Identity and Separatism|2015|p=48}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}  Arguably, it went further than the Delhi Agreement in some respects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|pp=171–172}}\n\nThe provisions implementing the Delhi Agreement were:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=198–200,&nbsp;212}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|pp=97–98}}\n# Indian citizenship was extended to the \'permanent residents\' of Jammu and Kashmir (formerly called \'state subjects\'). Simultaneously, the [[Article 35A of Constitution of India|Article 35A]] was added to the Constitution, empowering the state legislature to legislate on the privileges of permanent residents with regard to immovable property, settlement in the state and employment.\n# The [[Fundamental rights in India|fundamental rights]] of the Indian constitution were extended to the state. However, the State Legislature was empowered to legislate on preventive detention for the purpose of internal security. The State\'s land reform legislation (which acquired land without compensation) was also protected.\n# The jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of India]] was extended to the State.\n# The Central Government was given power to declare [[Part XVIII of the Constitution of India|national emergency]] in the event of external aggression. However, its power to do so for internal disturbances could be exercised only with the concurrence of the State Government.\nIn addition, the following provisions which were not previously decided in the Delhi Agreement were also implemented:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=212}}{{sfnp|Mir Qasim, My Life and Times|1992|p=60}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}\n# Financial relations between the Centre and the State were placed on the same footing as the other States.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will". The successors of Nanda in the Home Ministry have interpreted the Article in the same manner.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1–2, Chapter 9 Doc#2}}\n\n==Autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir: Structure and limitations==\nIndia\'s constitution is a [[Federalism in India|federal structure]]. The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} However, the State\'s constituent assembly dissolved itself on 25 January 1957 without recommending either abrogation or amendment of the Article 370.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\').

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda. They joined the Constituent Assembly on 16 June 1949.</ref> requested that only those provisions of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the original Instrument of Accession should be applied to the State and that the state\'s constituent assembly, when formed, would decide on the other matters. Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May. It said in particular, "It will be for the Constituent Assembly of the State when convened, to determine in respect of which other subjects the state may accede".{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011||loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}}} Accordingly, the Article 370 was incorporated into the Indian Constitution, which stipulated that the other articles of the Constitution that gave powers to the Central Government would be applied to Jammu and Kashmir only with the concurrence of the State\'s constituent assembly.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954. Issued with the agreement of the State\'s Constituent Assembly, it was a comprehensive order seeking to implement the 1952 Delhi Agreement.{{sfnp|Chowdhary, Politics of Identity and Separatism|2015|p=48}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}  Arguably, it went further than the Delhi Agreement in some respects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|pp=171–172}}\n\nThe provisions implementing the Delhi Agreement were:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=198–200,&nbsp;212}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|pp=97–98}}\n# Indian citizenship was extended to the \'permanent residents\' of Jammu and Kashmir (formerly called \'state subjects\'). Simultaneously, the [[Article 35A of Constitution of India|Article 35A]] was added to the Constitution, empowering the state legislature to legislate on the privileges of permanent residents with regard to immovable property, settlement in the state and employment.\n# The [[Fundamental rights in India|fundamental rights]] of the Indian constitution were extended to the state. However, the State Legislature was empowered to legislate on preventive detention for the purpose of internal security. The State\'s land reform legislation (which acquired land without compensation) was also protected.\n# The jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of India]] was extended to the State.\n# The Central Government was given power to declare [[Part XVIII of the Constitution of India|national emergency]] in the event of external aggression. However, its power to do so for internal disturbances could be exercised only with the concurrence of the State Government.\nIn addition, the following provisions which were not previously decided in the Delhi Agreement were also implemented:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=212}}{{sfnp|Mir Qasim, My Life and Times|1992|p=60}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}\n# Financial relations between the Centre and the State were placed on the same footing as the other States.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will". The successors of Nanda in the Home Ministry have interpreted the Article in the same manner.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1–2, Chapter 9 Doc#2}}\n\n==Autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir: Structure and limitations==\nIndia\'s constitution is a [[Federalism in India|federal structure]]. The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} However, the State\'s constituent assembly dissolved itself on 25 January 1957 without recommending either abrogation or amendment of the Article 370.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\').

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda. They joined the Constituent Assembly on 16 June 1949.</ref> requested that only those provisions of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the original Instrument of Accession should be applied to the State and that the state\'s constituent assembly, when formed, would decide on the other matters. Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May. It said in particular, "It will be for the Constituent Assembly of the State when convened, to determine in respect of which other subjects the state may accede".{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011||loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}}} Accordingly, the Article 370 was incorporated into the Indian Constitution, which stipulated that the other articles of the Constitution that gave powers to the Central Government would be applied to Jammu and Kashmir only with the concurrence of the State\'s constituent assembly.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954. Issued with the agreement of the State\'s Constituent Assembly, it was a comprehensive order seeking to implement the 1952 Delhi Agreement.{{sfnp|Chowdhary, Politics of Identity and Separatism|2015|p=48}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}  Arguably, it went further than the Delhi Agreement in some respects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|pp=171–172}}\n\nThe provisions implementing the Delhi Agreement were:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=198–200,&nbsp;212}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|pp=97–98}}\n# Indian citizenship was extended to the \'permanent residents\' of Jammu and Kashmir (formerly called \'state subjects\'). Simultaneously, the [[Article 35A of Constitution of India|Article 35A]] was added to the Constitution, empowering the state legislature to legislate on the privileges of permanent residents with regard to immovable property, settlement in the state and employment.\n# The [[Fundamental rights in India|fundamental rights]] of the Indian constitution were extended to the state. However, the State Legislature was empowered to legislate on preventive detention for the purpose of internal security. The State\'s land reform legislation (which acquired land without compensation) was also protected.\n# The jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of India]] was extended to the State.\n# The Central Government was given power to declare [[Part XVIII of the Constitution of India|national emergency]] in the event of external aggression. However, its power to do so for internal disturbances could be exercised only with the concurrence of the State Government.\nIn addition, the following provisions which were not previously decided in the Delhi Agreement were also implemented:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=212}}{{sfnp|Mir Qasim, My Life and Times|1992|p=60}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}\n# Financial relations between the Centre and the State were placed on the same footing as the other States.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will". The successors of Nanda in the Home Ministry have interpreted the Article in the same manner.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1–2, Chapter 9 Doc#2}}\n\n==Autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir: Structure and limitations==\nIndia\'s constitution is a [[Federalism in India|federal structure]]. The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} However, the State\'s constituent assembly dissolved itself on 25 January 1957 without recommending either abrogation or amendment of the Article 370.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\').

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

The scholarly literature on the subject is illustrative; as is typical in a conflict situation, law, history, and politics can all be plausibly interpreted (or manipulated, in the eyes of the opposing viewpoint) to demonstrate the legitimacy of one viewpoint or the other."}} Among other constitutional provisions, the "Article 370 limited the authority of the Indian National Parliament to pass legislation for the State of Jammu and Kashmir, granting some degree of autonomy to the state", states Farrell.{{sfn|Brian Farrell|2003|p=301}} Since mid-1954, this autonomy was slowly abrogated and the powers of Indian president and central government were drastically increased.{{sfn|Brian Farrell|2003|p=302}} \n\nAccording to Farrell, the applicability of the international law on Kashmiri autonomy must be considered under its doctrine of inter-temporal law. This doctrine requires that the "situation in question must be analyzed in light of the rules of international law as they existed at the time". The self-determination related norms of international law developed fully over the 1960s, were adopted in 1970, and these did not apply to Kashmir as binding law at the time of the partition in 1947.{{sfn|Brian Farrell|2003|pp=309-310}} Further, the upheavals and changing demographics since 1947 in the disputed Kashmir region raise the difficult question as to who should rightfully exercise the right to self-determination.{{sfn|Brian Farrell|2003|pp=314-315, also see footnote 21 on page 297}} According to Sumathi Subbiah, the United Nations Security Council lacks the capacity to adjudicate these disputes in international law terms and has dealt with the dispute in political terms.{{sfn|Sumathi Subbiah|2004|pp=181-182}}\n\n==Calls for abrogation==\nIn 2014, as part of [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] manifesto for [[2014 Indian general election|the 2014 general election]], the party pledged to integrate the state of Jammu and Kashmir into the Union of India.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.bjp.org/images/pdf_2014/full_manifesto_english_07.04.2014.pdf|title = BJP Manifesto for 2014 General Elections|date = |accessdate = 17 September 2015 |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> After winning the elections, attempts were made by the party along with its parent organisation, the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), for the abrogation of Article 370.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/omar-abdullah-ram-madhav-start-war-of-words-over-article-370/articleshow/35694199.cms |title=Omar Abdullah & Ram Madhav start war of words over Article 370 - Economic Times |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |date=2014-05-29 |accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref> Former prince regent and [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] leader [[Karan Singh]] opined that an integral review of Article 370 was overdue and, it need to be worked on jointly with the State of Jammu and Kashmir.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Article 370: Integral review of Article 370 overdue, but needs cooperation not confrontation: Congress leader Karan Singh |website=The Times of India |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Integral-review-of-Article-370-overdue-but-needs-cooperation-not-confrontation-Congress-leader-Karan-Singh/articleshow/35733023.cms }}</ref>\n\nHowever, in October 2015, the [[High Court of Jammu and Kashmir]] ruled that the Article 370 cannot be "abrogated, repealed or even amended."

Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India.

It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards.

The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954.

However, the State Legislature was empowered to legislate on preventive detention for the purpose of internal security.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will".

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} However, the State\'s constituent assembly dissolved itself on 25 January 1957 without recommending either abrogation or amendment of the Article 370.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\').

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda. They joined the Constituent Assembly on 16 June 1949.</ref> requested that only those provisions of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the original Instrument of Accession should be applied to the State and that the state\'s constituent assembly, when formed, would decide on the other matters. Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954. Issued with the agreement of the State\'s Constituent Assembly, it was a comprehensive order seeking to implement the 1952 Delhi Agreement.{{sfnp|Chowdhary, Politics of Identity and Separatism|2015|p=48}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}  Arguably, it went further than the Delhi Agreement in some respects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|pp=171–172}}\n\nThe provisions implementing the Delhi Agreement were:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=198–200,&nbsp;212}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|pp=97–98}}\n# Indian citizenship was extended to the \'permanent residents\' of Jammu and Kashmir (formerly called \'state subjects\'). Simultaneously, the [[Article 35A of Constitution of India|Article 35A]] was added to the Constitution, empowering the state legislature to legislate on the privileges of permanent residents with regard to immovable property, settlement in the state and employment.\n# The [[Fundamental rights in India|fundamental rights]] of the Indian constitution were extended to the state. However, the State Legislature was empowered to legislate on preventive detention for the purpose of internal security. The State\'s land reform legislation (which acquired land without compensation) was also protected.\n# The jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of India]] was extended to the State.\n# The Central Government was given power to declare [[Part XVIII of the Constitution of India|national emergency]] in the event of external aggression. However, its power to do so for internal disturbances could be exercised only with the concurrence of the State Government.\nIn addition, the following provisions which were not previously decided in the Delhi Agreement were also implemented:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=212}}{{sfnp|Mir Qasim, My Life and Times|1992|p=60}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}\n# Financial relations between the Centre and the State were placed on the same footing as the other States.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will". The successors of Nanda in the Home Ministry have interpreted the Article in the same manner.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1–2, Chapter 9 Doc#2}}\n\n==Autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir: Structure and limitations==\nIndia\'s constitution is a [[Federalism in India|federal structure]]. The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} However, the State\'s constituent assembly dissolved itself on 25 January 1957 without recommending either abrogation or amendment of the Article 370.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\').

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954. Issued with the agreement of the State\'s Constituent Assembly, it was a comprehensive order seeking to implement the 1952 Delhi Agreement.{{sfnp|Chowdhary, Politics of Identity and Separatism|2015|p=48}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}  Arguably, it went further than the Delhi Agreement in some respects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|pp=171–172}}\n\nThe provisions implementing the Delhi Agreement were:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=198–200,&nbsp;212}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|pp=97–98}}\n# Indian citizenship was extended to the \'permanent residents\' of Jammu and Kashmir (formerly called \'state subjects\'). Simultaneously, the [[Article 35A of Constitution of India|Article 35A]] was added to the Constitution, empowering the state legislature to legislate on the privileges of permanent residents with regard to immovable property, settlement in the state and employment.\n# The [[Fundamental rights in India|fundamental rights]] of the Indian constitution were extended to the state. However, the State Legislature was empowered to legislate on preventive detention for the purpose of internal security. The State\'s land reform legislation (which acquired land without compensation) was also protected.\n# The jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of India]] was extended to the State.\n# The Central Government was given power to declare [[Part XVIII of the Constitution of India|national emergency]] in the event of external aggression. However, its power to do so for internal disturbances could be exercised only with the concurrence of the State Government.\nIn addition, the following provisions which were not previously decided in the Delhi Agreement were also implemented:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=212}}{{sfnp|Mir Qasim, My Life and Times|1992|p=60}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}\n# Financial relations between the Centre and the State were placed on the same footing as the other States.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will". The successors of Nanda in the Home Ministry have interpreted the Article in the same manner.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1–2, Chapter 9 Doc#2}}\n\n==Autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir: Structure and limitations==\nIndia\'s constitution is a [[Federalism in India|federal structure]]. The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\').

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda. They joined the Constituent Assembly on 16 June 1949.</ref> requested that only those provisions of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the original Instrument of Accession should be applied to the State and that the state\'s constituent assembly, when formed, would decide on the other matters. Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May. It said in particular, "It will be for the Constituent Assembly of the State when convened, to determine in respect of which other subjects the state may accede".{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011||loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}}} Accordingly, the Article 370 was incorporated into the Indian Constitution, which stipulated that the other articles of the Constitution that gave powers to the Central Government would be applied to Jammu and Kashmir only with the concurrence of the State\'s constituent assembly.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954. Issued with the agreement of the State\'s Constituent Assembly, it was a comprehensive order seeking to implement the 1952 Delhi Agreement.{{sfnp|Chowdhary, Politics of Identity and Separatism|2015|p=48}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}  Arguably, it went further than the Delhi Agreement in some respects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|pp=171–172}}\n\nThe provisions implementing the Delhi Agreement were:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=198–200,&nbsp;212}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|pp=97–98}}\n# Indian citizenship was extended to the \'permanent residents\' of Jammu and Kashmir (formerly called \'state subjects\'). Simultaneously, the [[Article 35A of Constitution of India|Article 35A]] was added to the Constitution, empowering the state legislature to legislate on the privileges of permanent residents with regard to immovable property, settlement in the state and employment.\n# The [[Fundamental rights in India|fundamental rights]] of the Indian constitution were extended to the state. However, the State Legislature was empowered to legislate on preventive detention for the purpose of internal security. The State\'s land reform legislation (which acquired land without compensation) was also protected.\n# The jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of India]] was extended to the State.\n# The Central Government was given power to declare [[Part XVIII of the Constitution of India|national emergency]] in the event of external aggression. However, its power to do so for internal disturbances could be exercised only with the concurrence of the State Government.\nIn addition, the following provisions which were not previously decided in the Delhi Agreement were also implemented:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=212}}{{sfnp|Mir Qasim, My Life and Times|1992|p=60}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}\n# Financial relations between the Centre and the State were placed on the same footing as the other States.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will". The successors of Nanda in the Home Ministry have interpreted the Article in the same manner.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1–2, Chapter 9 Doc#2}}\n\n==Autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir: Structure and limitations==\nIndia\'s constitution is a [[Federalism in India|federal structure]]. The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} However, the State\'s constituent assembly dissolved itself on 25 January 1957 without recommending either abrogation or amendment of the Article 370.

The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} \n\nThe [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]], including the elected Kashmiri representatives, decided that "State of Jammu and Kashmir is and shall be an integral part of the Union of India", as stated in the Preamble and Article 3 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir, which was adopted on November 17, 1956 .<ref name="Official website of Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly."/> Article 5 stated that the executive and legislative power of the State extend to all matters except those with respect to which Parliament has power to make laws for the State under the provisions of the Constitution of India.

Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952.

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened.

After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards.

The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will".

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} \n\nThe [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]], including the elected Kashmiri representatives, decided that "State of Jammu and Kashmir is and shall be an integral part of the Union of India", as stated in the Preamble and Article 3 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir, which was adopted on November 17, 1956 .<ref name="Official website of Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly."/> Article 5 stated that the executive and legislative power of the State extend to all matters except those with respect to which Parliament has power to make laws for the State under the provisions of the Constitution of India.

In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State.

Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952.

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} \n\nConstituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir, including the Kashmiri representatives, decided that "State of Jammu and Kashmir is and shall be an integral part of the Union of India", as stated in the Preamble and Article 3 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir, which was adopted on November 17, 1956 .<ref name="Official website of Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly."/> Article 5 stated that the executive and legislative power of the State extend to all matters except those with respect to which Parliament has power to make laws for the State under the provisions of the Constitution of India.

Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952.

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened.

After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards.

The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will".

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State.

However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will". The successors of Nanda in the Home Ministry have interpreted the Article in the same manner.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1–2, Chapter 9 Doc#2}}\n\n==Autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir: Structure and limitations==\nIndia\'s constitution is a [[Federalism in India|federal structure]]. The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda. They joined the Constituent Assembly on 16 June 1949.</ref> requested that only those provisions of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the original Instrument of Accession should be applied to the State and that the state\'s constituent assembly, when formed, would decide on the other matters. Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May. It said in particular, "It will be for the Constituent Assembly of the State when convened, to determine in respect of which other subjects the state may accede".{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011||loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}}} Accordingly, the Article 370 was incorporated into the Indian Constitution, which stipulated that the other articles of the Constitution that gave powers to the Central Government would be applied to Jammu and Kashmir only with the concurrence of the State\'s constituent assembly.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954. Issued with the agreement of the State\'s Constituent Assembly, it was a comprehensive order seeking to implement the 1952 Delhi Agreement.{{sfnp|Chowdhary, Politics of Identity and Separatism|2015|p=48}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}  Arguably, it went further than the Delhi Agreement in some respects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|pp=171–172}}\n\nThe provisions implementing the Delhi Agreement were:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=198–200,&nbsp;212}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|pp=97–98}}\n# Indian citizenship was extended to the \'permanent residents\' of Jammu and Kashmir (formerly called \'state subjects\'). Simultaneously, the [[Article 35A of Constitution of India|Article 35A]] was added to the Constitution, empowering the state legislature to legislate on the privileges of permanent residents with regard to immovable property, settlement in the state and employment.\n# The [[Fundamental rights in India|fundamental rights]] of the Indian constitution were extended to the state. However, the State Legislature was empowered to legislate on preventive detention for the purpose of internal security. The State\'s land reform legislation (which acquired land without compensation) was also protected.\n# The jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of India]] was extended to the State.\n# The Central Government was given power to declare [[Part XVIII of the Constitution of India|national emergency]] in the event of external aggression. However, its power to do so for internal disturbances could be exercised only with the concurrence of the State Government.\nIn addition, the following provisions which were not previously decided in the Delhi Agreement were also implemented:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=212}}{{sfnp|Mir Qasim, My Life and Times|1992|p=60}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}\n# Financial relations between the Centre and the State were placed on the same footing as the other States.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will". The successors of Nanda in the Home Ministry have interpreted the Article in the same manner.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1–2, Chapter 9 Doc#2}}\n\n==Autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir: Structure and limitations==\nIndia\'s constitution is a [[Federalism in India|federal structure]]. The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} However, the State\'s constituent assembly dissolved itself on 25 January 1957 without recommending either abrogation or amendment of the Article 370.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\').

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda. They joined the Constituent Assembly on 16 June 1949.</ref> requested that only those provisions of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the original Instrument of Accession should be applied to the State and that the state\'s constituent assembly, when formed, would decide on the other matters. Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May. It said in particular, "It will be for the Constituent Assembly of the State when convened, to determine in respect of which other subjects the state may accede".{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011||loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}}} Accordingly, the Article 370 was incorporated into the Indian Constitution, which stipulated that the other articles of the Constitution that gave powers to the Central Government would be applied to Jammu and Kashmir only with the concurrence of the State\'s constituent assembly.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954. Issued with the agreement of the State\'s Constituent Assembly, it was a comprehensive order seeking to implement the 1952 Delhi Agreement.{{sfnp|Chowdhary, Politics of Identity and Separatism|2015|p=48}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}  Arguably, it went further than the Delhi Agreement in some respects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|pp=171–172}}\n\nThe provisions implementing the Delhi Agreement were:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=198–200,&nbsp;212}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|pp=97–98}}\n# Indian citizenship was extended to the \'permanent residents\' of Jammu and Kashmir (formerly called \'state subjects\'). Simultaneously, the [[Article 35A of Constitution of India|Article 35A]] was added to the Constitution, empowering the state legislature to legislate on the privileges of permanent residents with regard to immovable property, settlement in the state and employment.\n# The [[Fundamental rights in India|fundamental rights]] of the Indian constitution were extended to the state. However, the State Legislature was empowered to legislate on preventive detention for the purpose of internal security. The State\'s land reform legislation (which acquired land without compensation) was also protected.\n# The jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of India]] was extended to the State.\n# The Central Government was given power to declare [[Part XVIII of the Constitution of India|national emergency]] in the event of external aggression. However, its power to do so for internal disturbances could be exercised only with the concurrence of the State Government.\nIn addition, the following provisions which were not previously decided in the Delhi Agreement were also implemented:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=212}}{{sfnp|Mir Qasim, My Life and Times|1992|p=60}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}\n# Financial relations between the Centre and the State were placed on the same footing as the other States.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will". The successors of Nanda in the Home Ministry have interpreted the Article in the same manner.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1–2, Chapter 9 Doc#2}}\n\n==Autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir: Structure and limitations==\nIndia\'s constitution is a [[Federalism in India|federal structure]]. The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} However, the State\'s constituent assembly dissolved itself on 25 January 1957 without recommending either abrogation or amendment of the Article 370.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement.

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda. They joined the Constituent Assembly on 16 June 1949.</ref> requested that only those provisions of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the original Instrument of Accession should be applied to the State and that the state\'s constituent assembly, when formed, would decide on the other matters. Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May. It said in particular, "It will be for the Constituent Assembly of the State when convened, to determine in respect of which other subjects the state may accede".{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011||loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}}} Accordingly, the Article 370 was incorporated into the Indian Constitution, which stipulated that the other articles of the Constitution that gave powers to the Central Government would be applied to Jammu and Kashmir only with the concurrence of the State\'s constituent assembly.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954. Issued with the agreement of the State\'s Constituent Assembly, it was a comprehensive order seeking to implement the 1952 Delhi Agreement.{{sfnp|Chowdhary, Politics of Identity and Separatism|2015|p=48}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}  Arguably, it went further than the Delhi Agreement in some respects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|pp=171–172}}\n\nThe provisions implementing the Delhi Agreement were:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=198–200,&nbsp;212}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|pp=97–98}}\n# Indian citizenship was extended to the \'permanent residents\' of Jammu and Kashmir (formerly called \'state subjects\'). Simultaneously, the [[Article 35A of Constitution of India|Article 35A]] was added to the Constitution, empowering the state legislature to legislate on the privileges of permanent residents with regard to immovable property, settlement in the state and employment.\n# The [[Fundamental rights in India|fundamental rights]] of the Indian constitution were extended to the state. However, the State Legislature was empowered to legislate on preventive detention for the purpose of internal security. The State\'s land reform legislation (which acquired land without compensation) was also protected.\n# The jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of India]] was extended to the State.\n# The Central Government was given power to declare [[Part XVIII of the Constitution of India|national emergency]] in the event of external aggression. However, its power to do so for internal disturbances could be exercised only with the concurrence of the State Government.\nIn addition, the following provisions which were not previously decided in the Delhi Agreement were also implemented:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=212}}{{sfnp|Mir Qasim, My Life and Times|1992|p=60}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}\n# Financial relations between the Centre and the State were placed on the same footing as the other States.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will". The successors of Nanda in the Home Ministry have interpreted the Article in the same manner.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1–2, Chapter 9 Doc#2}}\n\n==Autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir: Structure and limitations==\nIndia\'s constitution is a [[Federalism in India|federal structure]]. The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} However, the State\'s constituent assembly dissolved itself on 25 January 1957 without recommending either abrogation or amendment of the Article 370.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\').

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda. They joined the Constituent Assembly on 16 June 1949.</ref> requested that only those provisions of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the original Instrument of Accession should be applied to the State and that the state\'s constituent assembly, when formed, would decide on the other matters. Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May. It said in particular, "It will be for the Constituent Assembly of the State when convened, to determine in respect of which other subjects the state may accede".{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011||loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}}} Accordingly, the Article 370 was incorporated into the Indian Constitution, which stipulated that the other articles of the Constitution that gave powers to the Central Government would be applied to Jammu and Kashmir only with the concurrence of the State\'s constituent assembly.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954. Issued with the agreement of the State\'s Constituent Assembly, it was a comprehensive order seeking to implement the 1952 Delhi Agreement.{{sfnp|Chowdhary, Politics of Identity and Separatism|2015|p=48}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}  Arguably, it went further than the Delhi Agreement in some respects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|pp=171–172}}\n\nThe provisions implementing the Delhi Agreement were:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=198–200,&nbsp;212}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|pp=97–98}}\n# Indian citizenship was extended to the \'permanent residents\' of Jammu and Kashmir (formerly called \'state subjects\'). Simultaneously, the [[Article 35A of Constitution of India|Article 35A]] was added to the Constitution, empowering the state legislature to legislate on the privileges of permanent residents with regard to immovable property, settlement in the state and employment.\n# The [[Fundamental rights in India|fundamental rights]] of the Indian constitution were extended to the state. However, the State Legislature was empowered to legislate on preventive detention for the purpose of internal security. The State\'s land reform legislation (which acquired land without compensation) was also protected.\n# The jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of India]] was extended to the State.\n# The Central Government was given power to declare [[Part XVIII of the Constitution of India|national emergency]] in the event of external aggression. However, its power to do so for internal disturbances could be exercised only with the concurrence of the State Government.\nIn addition, the following provisions which were not previously decided in the Delhi Agreement were also implemented:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=212}}{{sfnp|Mir Qasim, My Life and Times|1992|p=60}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}\n# Financial relations between the Centre and the State were placed on the same footing as the other States.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will". The successors of Nanda in the Home Ministry have interpreted the Article in the same manner.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1–2, Chapter 9 Doc#2}}\n\n==Autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir: Structure and limitations==\nIndia\'s constitution is a [[Federalism in India|federal structure]]. The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} However, the State\'s constituent assembly dissolved itself on 25 January 1957 without recommending either abrogation or amendment of the Article 370.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\').

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda. They joined the Constituent Assembly on 16 June 1949.</ref> requested that only those provisions of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the original Instrument of Accession should be applied to the State and that the state\'s constituent assembly, when formed, would decide on the other matters. Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May. It said in particular, "It will be for the Constituent Assembly of the State when convened, to determine in respect of which other subjects the state may accede".{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011||loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}}} Accordingly, the Article 370 was incorporated into the Indian Constitution, which stipulated that the other articles of the Constitution that gave powers to the Central Government would be applied to Jammu and Kashmir only with the concurrence of the State\'s constituent assembly.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to extend to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'). Despite reservations on this piecemeal approach to adopting provisions, the Central Government acquiesced, leading to the Presidential Order of 1952. The Legislative Assembly elected [[Karan Singh]], who was already acting as the Prince Regent, as the new \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\'.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9}}\n\n===Presidential order of 1954===\nThe Presidential order of 1954, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\'\'\' came into force on 14 May 1954. Issued with the agreement of the State\'s Constituent Assembly, it was a comprehensive order seeking to implement the 1952 Delhi Agreement.{{sfnp|Chowdhary, Politics of Identity and Separatism|2015|p=48}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}  Arguably, it went further than the Delhi Agreement in some respects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|pp=171–172}}\n\nThe provisions implementing the Delhi Agreement were:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=198–200,&nbsp;212}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|pp=97–98}}\n# Indian citizenship was extended to the \'permanent residents\' of Jammu and Kashmir (formerly called \'state subjects\'). Simultaneously, the [[Article 35A of Constitution of India|Article 35A]] was added to the Constitution, empowering the state legislature to legislate on the privileges of permanent residents with regard to immovable property, settlement in the state and employment.\n# The [[Fundamental rights in India|fundamental rights]] of the Indian constitution were extended to the state. However, the State Legislature was empowered to legislate on preventive detention for the purpose of internal security. The State\'s land reform legislation (which acquired land without compensation) was also protected.\n# The jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of India]] was extended to the State.\n# The Central Government was given power to declare [[Part XVIII of the Constitution of India|national emergency]] in the event of external aggression. However, its power to do so for internal disturbances could be exercised only with the concurrence of the State Government.\nIn addition, the following provisions which were not previously decided in the Delhi Agreement were also implemented:{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=212}}{{sfnp|Mir Qasim, My Life and Times|1992|p=60}}{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|pp=264–274}}\n# Financial relations between the Centre and the State were placed on the same footing as the other States.

According to him, Article 370 was "the only way" of taking the Constitution of India into Jammu and Kashmir, it is a tunnel through which "a good deal of traffic has already passed and more will". The successors of Nanda in the Home Ministry have interpreted the Article in the same manner.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1–2, Chapter 9 Doc#2}}\n\n==Autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir: Structure and limitations==\nIndia\'s constitution is a [[Federalism in India|federal structure]]. The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.

All the princely states were invited to send representatives to India\'s Constituent Assembly, which was formulating a constitution for the whole of India. They were also encouraged to set up constituent assemblies for their own states. Most states were unable to set up assemblies in time, but a few states did, in particular [[Saurashtra Union]], [[Travancore-Cochin]] and [[Mysore State|Mysore]]. Even though the States Department developed a model constitution for the states, on 19 May 1949, the rulers and chief ministers of all the states met in the presence of States Department and agreed that separate constitutions for the states were not necessary. They accepted the Constitution of India as their own constitution. The states that did elect constituent assemblies suggested a few amendments which were accepted. The position of all the states (or unions of states) thus became equivalent to that of regular Indian provinces. In particular, this meant that the subjects available for legislation by the central and state governments was uniform across India.{{sfnp|Menon, The Story of Integration of the Indian States|1956|pp=467–469}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the representatives to the Constituent Assembly<ref>{{harvtxt|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction (p.&nbsp;4)}}: The representatives of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] were [[Sheikh Abdullah]], [[Mirza Mohammad Afzal Beg]], Maulana Mohammad Saeed Masoodi and Moti Ram Bagda.

Government of India agreed to the demands shortly before the above meeting with the other states.{{refn|group=note|The negotiations were held at the residence of Home minister [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] on 15–16 May 1949, and prime minister Nehru recorded the results in a letter on 18 May.

This was a "temporary provision" in that its applicability was intended to last till the formulation and adoption of the State\'s constitution.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|loc=Introduction}} However, the State\'s constituent assembly dissolved itself on 25 January 1957 without recommending either abrogation or amendment of the Article 370.

The State was within its rights to draft its own Constitution and to decide for itself what additional powers to expand to the Central Government. Article 370 was designed to protect those rights.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=1-2}}\nAccording to the constitutional scholar [[A. G. Noorani]], Article 370 records a \'solemn compact\'. Neither India nor the State can unilaterally amend or abrogate the Article except in accordance with the terms of the Article.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|p=1}}\n\nArticle 370 embodied six special provisions for Jammu and Kashmir:{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=5-6}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n# It exempted the State from the complete applicability of the Constitution of India. The State was conferred with the power to have its own Constitution.\n# Central legislative powers over the State were limited, at the time of framing, to the three subjects of defence, foreign affairs and communications.\n# Other constitutional powers of the Central Government could be extended to the State only with the concurrence of the State Government.\n# The \'concurrence\' was only provisional. It had to be ratified by the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\n# The State Government\'s authority to give \'concurrence\' lasted only until the State Constituent Assembly was convened. Once the State Constituent Assembly finalised the scheme of powers and dispersed, no further extension of powers was possible.\n# Article 370 could be abrogated or amended only upon the recommendation of the State\'s Constituent Assembly.\nOnce the State\'s Constitutional Assembly convened on 31 October 1951, the State Government\'s power to give `concurrence\' lapsed. After the Constituent Assembly dispersed on 17 November 1956, adopting a Constitution for the State, the only authority provided to extend more powers to the Central Government or to accept Central institutions vanished.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\nNoorani states that this understanding of the constitutionality of the Centre-State relations informed the decisions of India till 1957, but that it was abandoned afterwards. In subsequent years, other provisions continued to be extended to the State with the \'concurrence\' of the State Government.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=7-8}}{{sfnp|Kumar, The Constitutional and Legal Routes|2005|p=97}}{{sfnp|Tillin, Asymmetric Federalism|2016|p=546}}\n\n==Presidential orders==\nWhen Article 370 was originally created, only two articles of the Indian Constitution applied in full to Jammu and Kashmir. Other provisions of the Constitution would apply with exceptions and modifications specified by the President in his Order in consultation with or the concurrence of the government of the state.{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|p=284}} In exercise of these powers, as conferred by clause (1) of article 370 of the Constitution, the President made a series of orders with the concurrence of the Government of the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n===Presidential order of 1950===\nThe Presidential order of 1950, officially \'\'\'The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1950\'\'\', came into force on 26 January 1950 contemporaneously with the [[Constitution of India]]. It specified the subjects and articles of the Indian Constitution that corresponded to the Instrument of Accession as required by the clause b(i) of the Article 370.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=187}}{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThirty eight subjects from the [[Union List]] were mentioned as matters on which the Union legislature could make laws for the State. Certain articles in ten of the twenty-two parts of the Indian Constitution were extended to Jammu and Kashmir, with modifications and exceptions as agreed by the state government.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=187}}\n\nIn this first Presidential Order under Article 370 "235 articles of the Indian Constitution were inapplicable to the state of Jammu & Kashmir, 9 were partially applicable, and 29 were applicable in a modified form".{{sfnp|Sharma|1958|pp=284-286}}\n\nThis order was superseded by the Presidential order of 1954.\n\n===Presidential order of 1952===\nThe Presidential order of 1952 was issued on 15 November 1952, at the request of the state government. It amended the Article 370, replacing the phrase "recognised by the President as the [[Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]" by "recognized by the President on the recommendation of the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the State]] as the [[Sadr-i-Riyasat]]". The amendment represented the abolition of the [[Dogra dynasty|monarchy]] of Jammu and Kashmir.{{sfnp|Noorani, Article 370|2011|pp=8–9,&nbsp;224–225}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=200}}\n\n\'\'\'\'\'Background:\'\'\'\'\' The [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] was elected in 1951 and convened on 31 October 1951. The Basic Principles committee of the Constituent Assembly recommended the abolition of the monarchy, which was unanimously approved by the Assembly on 12 June 1952. In the same month, the Hindu-dominated [[Jammu Praja Parishad]] submitted a memorandum to the President of India demanding the full application of the Indian Constitution to the State. The Government of India summoned a delegation from Jammu and Kashmir in Delhi for discussions on the relations between the Centre and the State. After discussions, the \'\'\'1952 Delhi Agreement\'\'\' was reached.{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|1968|p=196–198}}\n\nThe State\'s prime minister [[Sheikh Abdullah]] was slow to implement the provisions of the Delhi Agreement. However, in August 1952, the State Constituent Assembly adopted a resolution abolishing the monarchy and replacing the position by an elected Head of State (called \'\'Sadar-i-Riyasat\'\').

The subjects for legislation are divided into a \'Union List\', a \'State List\', and a \'Concurrent List\'. The [[Union List]] of ninety-six subjects, including defence, military and foreign affairs, major transport systems, commercial issues like banking, stock exchanges and taxes, are provided for the Union government to legislate exclusively. The [[State List]] of sixty-six items covering prisons, agriculture, most industries and certain taxes, are available for States to legislate on. The [[Concurrent List]], on which both the Centre and States may legislate include criminal law, marriage, bankruptcy, trade unions, professions and price control. In case of conflict, the Union legislation takes precedence. The \'residual power\', to make laws on matters not specified in the Constitution, rests with the Union. The Union may also specify certain industries, waterways, ports etc. to be \'national\', in which case they become Union subjects.{{sfnp|Cottrell, Kashmir: The vanishing autonomy|2013|p=165}}\n\nIn the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the \'Union List\' and the \'Concurrent List\' were initially limited to the matters ceded in the Instrument of Accession; later, they were extended with the concurrence of the State Government. The \'residual powers\' continued to rest with the State rather than the Union. According to the State Autonomy Committee, ninety-four of the ninety-seven items in the Union List applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the provisions of the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Investigation and preventive detention did not apply. Of the \'Concurrent List\', twenty-six of the forty-seven items applied to Jammu and Kashmir; the items of marriage and divorce, infants and minors, transfer of property other than agricultural land, contracts and torts, bankruptcy, trusts, courts, family planning and charities had been omitted - i.e., the State had exclusive right to legislate on those matters.
